## Combined Round

tromino packing, I think it might be inclusion, exclusion principle
But yeah I'm not entirely certain, you'd have to figure out how to appropriately count them though
It is combinatorics related. 


tree coloring I don't know
dp on tree doesn't really work.
I think there may be some greedy idea

connnect buildings
minimum spanning tree
geometry, spatial 
circle
chords on a circle

when you draw a chord on the circle, you prevent anything on one side of the chord from being connected to anything across from the chord. 
so it divides up the remaining problem, cause they are now distinct from each other. 
I think you can divide up N^2 ways though, hmm that is not so great.  There will be N division steps
so N * N^2 is N^3, okay, not great but may pass some subtasks.
Now the question is how do you sum up these answers, take the best answer from each division I suppose. 

At each division you are forming a minimum spanning tree. 
how do you connect two divisions together? 
You need to take one of the two points that create the chord that is the dividing chord.  And for those nodes they need to connect to both a node on both sides and that should work. And just connect it to the node with minimum, okay this is a bit tricky, cause there could be a lot of other chords already formed before you get to this merge step.  And so that would not be easy, you'd have to pick chord so it doesn't intersect with any existing chords.  And still pick the smallest, pick the smallest chord that does not intersect. 

I don't know this is a bit weird, I think I'm off base a bit here.  I don't know if I have enough of an idea to begin implementing.  

In each division connect them back and so on. 

I think that would be N^2 time complexity if you just keep dividing the problem up into smaller and smaller problems.

### Solution 1:  ceil division

N, M = map(int, input().split())
ans = 0
for _ in range(N):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())

    ans = max(ans, math.ceil((M - a) / b))
print(ans + 1)

    grid = [input() for _ in range(N)]
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(N + 1)]
    ans = 1
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(M):
            for dr, dc in product([-1, 1], repeat = 2):
                if not in_bounds(r, c - dc) or grid[r][c - dc] == "#": continue
                if not in_bounds(r + dr, c) or grid[r + dr][c] == "#": continue
                dp[max(r, r + dr) + 1][c + 1] = (dp[max(r, r + dr) + 1][c + 1] + dp[r + 1][min(c, c - dc)]) % mod # add up the ones along the columns
                

    for r, c in product(range(N), range(M)):
        if grid[r][c] == "o":
            cnt = 0
            for dr, dc in product([-1, 1], repeat = 2):
                if not in_bounds(r, c - dc) or grid[r][c - dc] == "#": continue
                if not in_bounds(r + dr, c) or grid[r + dr][c] == "#": continue
                cnt += 1
            ans = (ans * cnt) % mod

=========================================


if it is 10^8 I could compute all factors in 10^4 time
and then you could try deleting each one, and check if it is divisble by any prime factor.
All you need are the prime factors


To get full credit you'd need some form of digit dp, but I'm not sure how you would check that it is divisible if you delete this one digit.
