# Google Codejam Round 1A

## Summary

I was only able to solve problem 1, I struggled on the rest, although it seems I could have solved problem 3 if I just did brute force and stopped trying to optimize.  but problem 2 I did not understand the trick to solve that one by using powers of 2.  Going to have to learn that type of optimizing technique.

### Solution 1: greedily pick to double if next character is greater lexi order
