# 1359. Count All Valid Pickup and Delivery Options

## Solution: recursive DP + combinatorics

How many ways to pick, so you have unpicked packages to pick so that 
is multiplied, or the other state is you choose to deliver in which cas you have 
undelivered-unpicked ways to deliver.  

```py
class Solution:
    def countOrders(self, n: int) -> int:
        MOD = int(1e9)+7
        
        @cache
        def total_ways(unpicked, undelivered):
            if unpicked == 0 and undelivered == 0: return 1
            if unpicked < 0 or undelivered < 0: return 0
            cnt = 0
            cnt = (cnt + unpicked*total_ways(unpicked-1, undelivered))%MOD
            cnt = (cnt + (undelivered-unpicked)*total_ways(unpicked, undelivered-1))%MOD
            return cnt
        return total_ways(n,n)
```


```py

```


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
        int MOD = 1e9+7;
        vector<vector<long long>> dp(n+1, vector<long long>(n+1, -1));
        function<long long(long long,long long)> totalWays = [&](long long unpicked, long long undelivered) {
            if (unpicked==0 && undelivered==0) return 1LL;
            if (unpicked < 0 || undelivered < 0) return 0LL;
            if (dp[unpicked][undelivered]!=-1) {
                return dp[unpicked][undelivered];
            }
            long long cnt = 0;
            cnt = (cnt + (unpicked*totalWays(unpicked-1,undelivered))%MOD)%MOD;
            cnt = (cnt + ((undelivered-unpicked)*totalWays(unpicked,undelivered-1))%MOD)%MOD;
            return dp[unpicked][undelivered] = cnt;
        };
        
        return totalWays(n,n);
    }
};
