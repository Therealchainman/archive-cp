# 2143. Choose Numbers from Two Arrays in Range

## Solution 1:  Recursive DP with storing the (index, balance)

Where balance is equal to 0 means that sum1==sum2, so we add for sum1 and subtract for sum2.

O(N^2), N = len(nums) and bal is bounded by 100n

```py
class Solution:
    def countSubranges(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        n, MOD=len(nums1), int(1e9)+7
        @cache
        def dfs(i, bal):
            if i==n: return bal==0
            return (bal==0) + dfs(i+1,bal+nums1[i]) + dfs(i+1,bal-nums2[i])
        sum_ = 0
        for i in range(n):
            sum_ = (sum_+dfs(i,0)-1)%MOD
        return sum_
```

## Solution 2: hashmap + counter store count of previous balances

We want the count of balance for each interval,  

so each state is a reference to the counts of each balance for all integers prior
Then we consider starting from current index i, and consider adding the positive and negative
to all previous balances that is taking a number and extending those ranges by 1 number

and starting a new range.  And we want the balances that are equal to 0 to contribute to final
answer because these are balances for all ranges that are [x,i], for some x<=i

```py
class Solution:
    def countSubranges(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        n, MOD=len(nums1), int(1e9)+7
        state = Counter()
        res = 0
        for x, y in zip(nums1,nums2):
            nstate = Counter()
            nstate[x]+=1
            nstate[-y]+=1
            for k, v in state.items():
                nstate[k+x] = (nstate[k+x]+v)%MOD
                nstate[k-y] = (nstate[k-y]+v)%MOD
            res = (res+nstate[0])%MOD
            state = nstate
        return res
```
