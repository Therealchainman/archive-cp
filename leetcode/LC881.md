```py
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        n=len(people)
        i = cnt = 0
        j = n-1
        while i <= j:
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                i += 1
            j -=1
            cnt += 1
        return cnt
