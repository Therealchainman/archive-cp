# 174. Dungeon Game

## Solution: iteratiive DP

I messed up again, but the idea is that all you need to track is 
the minimum needed health, if it ever goes is equal to 0 or below
then just set it to 1, cause you always need at least 1 health
point at any point in dungeon.  Then we look below and to right 
and take path with minimum needed health, then we subtract current
dungeon, so if it is negative it increases the needed health points


```py
class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        R, C = len(dungeon), len(dungeon[0])
        # (current health, need health)
        health = [[math.inf for _ in range(C+1)] for _ in range(R+1)]
        health[R][C-1] = 1
        health[R-1][C] = 1
        for r in range(R-1,-1,-1):
            for c in range(C-1,-1,-1):
                need = min(health[r+1][c],health[r][c+1]) - dungeon[r][c]
                health[r][c] = need if need>0 else 1
        return health[0][0]
```
