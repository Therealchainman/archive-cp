# 2228. Users With Two Purchases Within Seven Days

## Solution 1: inner join with datediff

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p1.user_id
FROM Purchases AS p1
INNER JOIN
Purchases AS p2
ON p1.user_id=p2.user_id
AND p1.purchase_id!=p2.purchase_id
AND ABS(DATEDIFF(p1.purchase_date, p2.purchase_date))<=7
ORDER BY p1.user_id
```

## Solution 2: temporary table with lag on purchase date
Then just check if any previous purchase date and purchase date is within 7 days

```sql
with cte as (
select purchase_id,user_id, lag(purchase_date) over(partition by user_id order by purchase_date) as prev_purchase_date, purchase_date 
from purchases
)
select distinct user_id
from cte
where datediff(purchase_date,prev_purchase_date)<=7
```
