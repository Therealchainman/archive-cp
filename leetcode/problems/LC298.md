# 289. Game of Life

## Solution 1: FSM (finite state machine) + Mark matrix for transition states in-place (dummy variables)

I can mark the matrix in place if I use negatives and positives, where positive represent
no transition and negatives represent transition to another state.  This works because
the states are binary, there are only two states.  I will need to mark dead state as 2 though for 
this idea.  Then if 1 is live, 2 is dead, then -1 transition to dead, -2 transition to live

In cellular automata the moore neighborhood is the 8 neighboring cells

        in_boundary = lambda r, c: 0<=r<R and 0<=c<C
