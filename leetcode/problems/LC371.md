# 371. Sum of Two Integers

## Solution:  Bit manipulation with XOR and AND operator

O(1) because 32 bits in each integer

Instead of performing addition and subtraction with base 10, do it in base 2 with bits.

This allows the use of bit manipulation which works in base 2 system. 

ADDITION:

xor of two integers gives the addition of the bits, but sometimes two bits are 1 and 1 and so there is a carry, we can compute
carry by taking the & bitwise operator between x and y and we want to shift theese to the left by 1.  so we can use the
bitwise left shift operator

so we have answer = x^y and carry = x&y << 1

then update x and y values with answer and carry and continue to add them until you have 0 carry

SUBTRACTION: 

xor of two integers, but this time if we are taking x - y, then when xi = 0 and yi = 1, then the x bit is smaller than y bit, so we need
to borrow from the left for this.  To do that we can compute the borrowing by taking the ~x, the not operator for x to invert it's bits
and take the inverted bits and see how many 1s match up with y.  so (~x)&y <<1, shift over by 1 to say let's borrow from the left

then we update our answer and borrow and update x and y and continue

        if x < y:
            return self.getSum(b,a)
        
        # a DETERMINES THE SIGN BECAUSE IT IS THE LARGER VALUE
        sign = 1 if a >= 0 else -1
        
        if a*b >= 0:
            # SUM OF TWO POSITIVE INTEGERS x + y
            # WHERE X > Y
            while y:
                answer = x ^ y
                carry = (x&y)<<1
                x, y = answer, carry
        else:
            # DIFFERENCE OF TWO INTEGERS x - y
            # WHERE x > y
            while y:
                answer = x^y
                borrow = ((~x)&y) << 1
                x, y = answer, borrow
        return sign*x
