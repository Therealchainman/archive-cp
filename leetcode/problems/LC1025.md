# 1025. Divisor Game

## Solution: iterative DP with terminal state + game theory

```c++
bool divisorGame(int n) {
    vector<bool> win(n+1,false);
    for (int i = 1;i<=n;i++) {
        for (int x = 1;x*x<i;x++) {
            if (i%x==0 && !win[i-x]) {
                win[i]=true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return win[n];
}
```

## Solution: iterative DP with a move generator in python

memory performant way in python. Without generator it would load all the moves into an array into memory at once.
Here it takes out one move at a time, would scale for if you have a large number of possible moves. 

```py
def getMoves(self, n):
    i = 1
    while i*i<n:
        if n%i==0:
            yield n-i   
        i+=1
def divisorGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
    win = [False for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if not all(win[move] for move in self.getMoves(i)):
            win[i]=True
    return win[-1]
```
