# 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle

### Solution: Math 

The only time it cannot be enclosed by a circle is when the speed is nonconstant and direction constant for a set of instructions. 
In other words, it is a limit cycle trajectory and not a divergent trajectory if it returns to initial positions or it doesn't point north after
the instructions are read in a single pass. 

```c++
bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
    int x = 0, y = 0; // initial positions in coordinate plane
    int dir = 0;  // 0->north, 1->east, 2->south, 3->west
    vector<int> change(26,0);
    change['L'-'A'] = -1;
    change['R'-'A'] = 1;
    vector<pair<int,int>> moves = {{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1},{-1,0}};
    auto mod = [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return (a+b)%b;
    };
    for (char& c : instructions) {
        if (c=='G') {
            int dx, dy;
            tie(dx,dy) = moves[dir];
            x+=dx;
            y+=dy;
        }
        dir = mod(dir+change[c-'A'], 4);
    }
    return (x==0 && y==0) || dir!=0;
}
```
