# 1057. Campus Bikes

## Solution: Sorting algorithm with manhattan distance then worker index, then bike index

Time complexity is nlogn, where n = len(bikes)*len(workers)

```py
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n, m = len(workers), len(bikes)
        def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        pairs = sorted([(manhattan_distance(x1,y1,x2,y2), i, j) for i, (x1, y1) in enumerate(workers) for j, (x2, y2) in enumerate(bikes)])
        workers_vis, bikes_vis = [0]*n, [0]*m
        cnt = 0
        bike_assigned = [0]*n
        for dist, i, j in pairs:
            if not workers_vis[i] and not bikes_vis[j]:
                bike_assigned[i] = j
                workers_vis[i] = 1
                bikes_vis[j] = 1
                cnt += 1
            if cnt == n: break
        return bike_assigned
```

## Solution: Bucket Sorting Algorithm

We can use bucket sorting algorithm because one of the values we want to sort on has a small input size. 

So for example there are up to 10^6 pairs for worker index and bike index. But there is only 
up to 1998 for manhattan distance, so we can just put all the indicies in the bucket correpsonding
to the manhattan distance. This way we don't need to sort, because the worker and bike index will already be 
in order in the buckets. So this reduces time to O(N*M+K), where K=1998

```py
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n, m = len(workers), len(bikes)
        def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        buckets = [[] for _ in range(1999)]
        for i, (x1, y1) in enumerate(workers):
            for j, (x2, y2) in enumerate(bikes):
                buckets[manhattan_distance(x1,y1,x2,y2)].append((i,j))
        workers_vis, bikes_vis = [0]*n, [0]*m
        bike_assigned = [0]*n
        for pairs in buckets:
            for i, j in pairs:
                if not workers_vis[i] and not bikes_vis[j]:
                    workers_vis[i] = 1
                    bikes_vis[j] = 1
                    bike_assigned[i] = j
        return bike_assigned
```

## Solution: min heap datastructure

```py
from heapq import heappush, heappop
class Solution:
    def assignBikes(self, workers: List[List[int]], bikes: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n, m = len(workers), len(bikes)
        def manhattan_distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        heap = []
        bike_pairs = []
        for i, (x1, y1) in enumerate(workers):
            bike_pairs.append(sorted([(manhattan_distance(x1,y1,x2,y2), i, j)  for j, (x2, y2) in enumerate(bikes)], reverse=True))
            heappush(heap, bike_pairs[-1].pop())
        bikes_vis = [0]*m
        bike_assigned = [0]*n
        while heap:
            dist, i, j = heappop(heap)
            if not bikes_vis[j]:
                bikes_vis[j] = 1
                bike_assigned[i] = j
            else:
                heappush(heap, bike_pairs[i].pop())
        return bike_assigned
```
