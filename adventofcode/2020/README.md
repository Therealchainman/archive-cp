# Advent of Code 2020

I took on the challenge to complete 25 programming challenges for the 25 days leading up to Christmas day.  
I am doing the challenge in the C++ language.

This was my first year participating in Advent of Code and I completed all 25 days.  
Some of the days I never saved my code and I don't plan to go back to resolve them.  
Next year I will keep a complete repository because it will be very interesting to look at my improvement.  
At the present I plan to do it in C++ next year as well.
