# 1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row



## Solution:  Hash table + Greedy

The idea for this solution is that I compute the count for each integer from 1 to 6 for tops and bottoms
and then if one of the integers 1 to 6 appears in either tops or bottoms through the entire
dominoes then it is possible to achieve all same intger via some number of rotations.
Then I find how many are missing from tops and from bottoms, and just perform those rotations

time complexity is about O(n)




```py
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, tops: List[int], bottoms: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(tops)
        ctops, cbots = Counter(tops), Counter(bottoms)
        min_rotations = math.inf
        for i in range(1,7):
            if sum(1 for top, bot in zip(tops, bottoms) if top==i or bot==i)==n:
                min_rotations = min(min_rotations, n-ctops[i], n-cbots[i])
        return min_rotations if min_rotations < math.inf else -1
```

## Solution: simpler greedy and faster

Just check the first element in tops and bottoms and find if I can rotate
all to tops or bottoms via that element and return the minimum.  

```py
class Solution:
    def minDominoRotations(self, tops: List[int], bottoms: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(tops)
        def get_rotations(val):
            rotations_top = rotations_bot = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if tops[i] != val and bottoms[i] != val: return -1
                elif tops[i] != val:
                    rotations_top += 1
                elif bottoms[i] != val:
                    rotations_bot += 1
            return min(rotations_top, rotations_bot)
        rotate1 = get_rotations(tops[0])
        rotate2 = get_rotations(bottoms[0])
        return rotate1 if rotate2==-1 else rotate2
```
