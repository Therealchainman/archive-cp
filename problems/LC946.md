# 946. Validate Stack Sequences

## Solution: Stack 

```py
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        stack = []
        i = 0
        for elem in pushed:
            stack.append(elem)
            while stack and stack[-1] == popped[i]:
                stack.pop()
                i+=1
        return not stack
```

## Solution: Simulate stack with two pointers

Using push as the stack 

```py
class Solution:
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed: List[int], popped: List[int]) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, 0
        for elem in pushed:
            pushed[i] = elem
            while i >= 0 and pushed[i]==popped[j]:
                j+=1
                i-=1
            i+=1
        return i==0
```
