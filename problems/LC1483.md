# 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node

## Solution: binary lifting (logarithmic data structure)

This is hard to explain, I had to walk through an example

But the steps I would draw out to understand are the following

1) Draw out how it precomputes the ancestors lookup table.  How does it generate the parents
2) draw out how it queries the lookup table. 

```py
class TreeAncestor:

    def __init__(self, n: int, parent: List[int]):
        C = 1+int(math.log2(n))
        self.table = [[-1 for _ in range(C)] for _ in range(n)]
        for c in range(C):
            for r in range(n):
                if c==0: self.table[r][c] = parent[r]
                elif self.table[r][c-1] != -1:
                    self.table[r][c] = self.table[self.table[r][c-1]][c-1]
    
    def getKthAncestor(self, node: int, k: int) -> int:
        while node != -1 and k>0:
            i = int(math.log2(k))
            node = self.table[node][i]
            k-=(1<<i)
        return node

```
