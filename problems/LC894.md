# 894. All Possible Full Binary Trees


## Solution: recursive DP 

This is a tricky problem but when you consider this it makes sense

You can have i==0 which means return empty list
you can have i==1 which means return a single treenode
you can have i=2, which means you need to try the combinations of having left of size 0, right of size 2, left of size 1, right of size 1, and left of size 0, and right of size 2
and so on.  Then it returns the array of full binary trees for that, then just need to iterate through left and right full binary trees to return the final array


```py
class Solution:
    def allPossibleFBT(self, n: int) -> List[Optional[TreeNode]]:

        @cache
        def dfs(i):
            if i==0: return []
            if i==1: return [TreeNode()]
            res = []
            for left in range(i):
                right = i-left-1
                leftTrees, rightTrees = dfs(left), dfs(right)
                for lt in leftTrees:
                    for rt in rightTrees:
                        res.append(TreeNode(0,lt,rt))
            return res
        return dfs(n)
```
