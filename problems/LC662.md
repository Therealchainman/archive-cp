# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree

My first thought was to store the horizontal distance from root node with DFS traversal.
But this doesn't really work though, it doesn't account for the null nodes properly as 
can be seen in the image.


Instead you have to come up with a clever indexing trick, where you start the root node at 1
and then left node will be 2*index and right node 2*index+1.  Let's build the intuition for 
this brilliant property.  

Suppose we have a tree with 3 nodes, and it looks like the following
We have some index for the root node, and then 2*index and 2*index+1 for left and right node.
if we were to takes 2*index+1-2*index+1 = 2 width, which is the correct width.  
If something works at this level, the only question is will it continue as we add more nodes.
But it will because from any root node, you will add a distance 2 between it's left and right
so if sum up those distances you will get the total distance across a level.  

## Solution: DFS + indexing + using extra space 

```py
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        dist = []
        
        def dfs(node, index, depth):
            if not node: return
            if depth == len(dist):
                dist.append([math.inf,-math.inf])
            dist[depth][0] = min(dist[depth][0], index)
            dist[depth][1] = max(dist[depth][1], index)
            dfs(node.left, 2*index, depth+1)
            dfs(node.right, 2*index+1,depth+1)
            
        dfs(root, 1, 0)
        max_width = -math.inf
        for left, right in dist:
            max_width = max(max_width, right-left+1)
        return max_width
```

## Solution: BFS traversal + indexing

```py
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:

        dq = deque()
        root.val = 1 # index it at 1
        dq.append((root))
        max_width = 0
        while dq:
            level_size = len(dq)
            first_index = -1
            for _ in range(level_size):
                node = dq.popleft()
                if first_index == -1: 
                    first_index = node.val
                max_width = max(max_width, node.val - first_index + 1)
                if node.left:
                    node.left.val = 2*node.val
                    dq.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    node.right.val = 2*node.val+1
                    dq.append(node.right)
        return max_width
```
