# 338. Counting Bits

## Solution: loop to count bits

The time complexity is NlogN. A kind of trivial solution, cause bit_count() counts the 
set bits in an integer.

```py
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        return [i.bit_count() for i in range(n+1)]
```


## Solution: dynamic programming + bit manipulation

This is O(N), so I have the print statement because it shows the pattern beautifully.
It shows how each range from a [base,2*b] is basically from taking all previos [0,b) and
just adding the 1 to each.  

recurrence relation
p(x+b) = p(x) + 1

```py
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0]*(n+1)
        b = 1
        x = 0
        d = {}
        while b <= n:
            d[b] = {}
            while x < b and b+x<=n:
                res[x+b] = res[x] + 1
                d[b][x+b] = f'{x}+{b}={x+b} <-> {bin(x)[2:]}+{bin(b)[2:]}={bin(x+b)[2:]}'
                x += 1
            x = 0
            b <<= 1
        print(d)
        return res
```

## Solution: bit manipulation + dynamic programming

use recurrence relation
p(x) = p(x&(x-1))+1

This works because x&(x-1) basically just set's the rightmost bit to zero. 
Since you are setting exactly one bit to zero and it is a smaller value, you 
just need to add 1 more bit for x from how ever many bits x&(x-1) has.

```py
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        res = [0]*(n+1)
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            res[i] = res[i&(i-1)]+1
        return res
```
