Single element in a sorted array

| Solution             | TC      | SC   |
| :---                 |  :----: | ---: |
| xor bit manipulation | O(n)    | O(1) |
| binary search        | O(logn) | O(1) |

First took a solution by taking the xor of all the elements.

```c++
int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    return accumulate(nums.begin(),nums.end(),0,[](const auto a, const auto b) {
        return a^b;
    });
}
```

Second took a solution with binary search, 
TTTTTFFFF, return the last T, where it is T if the start of any pair of two equal numbers is and even index
where it is F if the start of any pair of two equal numbers is an odd index.
[1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5] 
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] => Notice the pair (1,1) starts at 0, (2,2) starts at 2, (3) starts at 4, (4,4) starts at 5, (5,5) starts at 7

```c++
int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int lo = 0, hi = n-1;
    auto possible = [&](int i) {
        if (i>0 && nums[i-1]==nums[i]) {
            i--;
        }
        return i%2==0;
    };
    while (lo<hi) {
        int mid = lo+hi+1>>1;
        if (possible(mid)) {
            lo = mid;
        } else {
            hi = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return nums[lo];
}
```

Third solution is to improve on observation above with bit manipulation. 
FFFFTTTTT, return the first T, 

[1,1,2,2,3,4,4,5,5]
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] => Notice that for any element if you take it's complementary by flipping the 1 bit, it goes from even -> odd or odd -> even
3 -> 2 or 2 -> 3.  Again the pairs (1,1) => (0,1), (2,2) => (2,3), (3) => (4), (4,4) => (5,6), (5,5) => (7,8)
notice that the pairs to the left of the result when you flip the last bit they are equal nums[i]==nums[i^1] but after the result and including, when you flip the last bit nums[i]!=nums[i^1]

```c++
int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int lo = 0, hi = n-1;
    while (lo<hi) {
        int mid = lo+hi>>1;
        if (nums[mid]==nums[mid^1]) {
            lo = mid+1;
        } else {
            hi = mid;
        }
    }
    return nums[lo];
}
```
