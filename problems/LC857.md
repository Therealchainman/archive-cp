# 857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers

## Solution 1: greedy + max heap

To solve this we want to minimize the current_ratio*total_quality

So basically we add the k workers with the smallest ratios,  so when we get to the kth worker
we know that because expect[i] = wage[i] / quality[i], and if expect[i] < expect[j]
Then if we take quality[i] * expect[j], we will be paying more than the minimum wage of worker[i]

Cause paying with a higher dollars per quality means you will satisfy the dollars the other worker wanted per quality.

When we have k workers we take current ratio it will satisfy all the other works, but now we want to continue
because we desire to lower the quality, as it may help because we are paying per quality, so even though ratio increases
there is chance the quality decreases by enough to lower the minimum cost.  

```py
class Solution(object):
    def mincostToHireWorkers(self, quality, wage, k):
        heap = []
        workers = sorted([(w/q, q) for w, q in zip(wage, quality)])
        total_quality = 0
        minCost = inf
        for ratio, q in workers:
            heappush(heap, -q)
            total_quality += q
            if len(heap) > k:
                total_quality += heappop(heap)
            if len(heap) == k:
                minCost = min(minCost, ratio*total_quality)
        return minCost
