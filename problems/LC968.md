# 968. Binary Tree Cameras

## Solution:  Greedy + postorder traversal

This algorithm is postorder traversal of the tree.

state 0 => no camera, not covered
state 1 => no camera, covered
state 2 => camera

base case is state 1

if the left or right state is no camera, not covered, we need to place a camera here, and current state is 2
if the left or right state has camera, then the current state is 1
else the current state is 0

We do need to check if the root node is still not covered, and cover that if necessary with a camera. 

```py
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.covered = 0
        
        """
        state 0 => not covered, no camera
        state 1 => covered no camera
        state 2 => camera
        """
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 1
            leftState = dfs(node.left)
            rightState = dfs(node.right)
            if leftState==0 or rightState==0:
                self.covered+=1
                return 2
            if leftState==2 or rightState==2:
                return 1
            return 0
        if dfs(root)==0:
            self.covered+=1
        return self.covered
```

## Solution: DFS + postorder dynamic programming, saves the minimal value for state0, state1, state2.  

state0 represents not covered and no camera with all subtrees under it covered. For this state you need everything
beneath it to be in state1, because need to be covered with no camera

state1 represents covered with no camera with all subtrees under it covered.  For this state you need
a guarantee of at least one prior state being state 2.
it to be composed of one prior state2.  Because you need it
to have a camera beneath it to be covered. But you only need one
so you can take leftState2 + min(rightState1,rightState2), 
cause the camera is in left so right can be state1 or state2, just as long as it 
is covered

state2 represents covered with camera and all subtrees under it covered.  This is really simple it can have either state0
or state1 or state2 under it.  


```py
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        """
        state 0 => not covered, no camera
        state 1 => covered no camera
        state 2 => camera
        """

        @cache
        def dfs(node):
            if not node: return 0, 0, math.inf
            leftState = dfs(node.left)
            rightState = dfs(node.right)
            state0 = leftState[1] + rightState[1]
            state1 = min(leftState[2]+min(rightState[1:]), rightState[2]+min(leftState[1:]))
            state2 = 1 + min(leftState) + min(rightState)
            return state0, state1, state2
        return min(dfs(root)[1:])
