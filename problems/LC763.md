# 763. Partition Labels


## Solution: Greedy 

Store the last_index for each character, and keep a running value of where your current partition
should end to include the last_index of every character processed for the current partition.

```py
class Solution:
    def partitionLabels(self, s: str) -> List[int]:
        last_index = {ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(s)}
        labels = []
        end = start = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            end = max(end, last_index[s[i]])
            if i==end:
                labels.append(end-start+1)
                start = i+1
        return labels
            
```
