# 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

## Solution: BFS + bitmask + dynamic programming

The reason to use BFS is because we have an unweighted undirected graph, so I can imagine all weights are equal to 1.  So BFS will explore it optimally to return the shortest path.  I do need to store the (node, mask) , else it will continue visiting the same node with the same set of nodes visited in the path.  This is obviously already been computed.  So save the shortest path to reach some node aftering visitin g a set of nodes.  

TC: O(N*2^N)

```c++
int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    int n = graph.size();
    queue<vector<int>> q;
    int endMask = (1<<n)-1;
    vector<vector<bool>> vis(n, vector<bool>(1<<n, false));
    for (int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
        vis[i][(1<<i)]=true;
        q.push({i,(1<<i),0});
    }
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto v = q.front();
        int i = v[0], mask = v[1], path = v[2];
        q.pop();
        if (mask==endMask) return path;
        for (int nei : graph[i]) {
            int nmask = mask|(1<<nei);
            if (vis[nei][nmask]) continue;
            vis[nei][nmask] = true;
            q.push({nei, nmask, path+1});
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
