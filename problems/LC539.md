# 539. Minimum Time Difference

## Solution: Convert to integer minutes + sort, then compare adjacent in circular array with zip and mod by minutes in day.

Take a wheel to represent the minutes in a day
and mark all the times in it, we want the one with minimum difference
between the markings, including the first and last one
so we need a type of circular array

```py
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        minutes = sorted(60*int(time[:2])+int(time[-2:]) for time in timePoints)
        return min((y-x)%1440 for x,y in zip(minutes, minutes[1:]+minutes[:1]))
```
