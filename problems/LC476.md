# 476. Number Complement

### Solution: count bits with log2(x)=y which is same as x=2^y, but we know that if we have up to 2^2, we know that means we need 3 bits. 
Then using a bit trick where I am flipping all bits by taking 1011^1111=0100

```c++
int findComplement(int num) {
    return num ^ ((1LL<<(int)(log2(num)+1))-1);
}
```

### Solution: Implemented with python.  

```py
def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
    return num ^ ((1<<len(bin(num)[2:]))-1)
```

```py
def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
    return num ^ ((1<<num.bit_length())-1)
```
