# 311. Sparse Matrix Multiplication

## Solution:  brute force algorithm multiply two matrices

the time complexity of this algorithm is O(NMK), but if we have square matrices of N x N, 
then we can see it is O(N^3), so it is going to be tricky to do this in an efficient manner.


```py
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, mat1: List[List[int]], mat2: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n, k = len(mat1), len(mat2[0]), len(mat2)
        M = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                M[i][j] = sum(mat1[i][ii]*mat2[ii][j] for ii in range(k))
        return M
```

## Solution: Optimize the matrix multiplication by skipping if the current element is 0 in the row, no reason to iterate over the column of matrix 2 and multiply

```py
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, mat1: List[List[int]], mat2: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n, k = len(mat1), len(mat2[0]), len(mat2)
        M = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for ii in range(k):
                if mat1[i][ii] == 0: continue
                for j in range(n):
                    M[i][j] += mat1[i][ii]*mat2[ii][j]
        return M
```
