# 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers

## Solution 1: recursive DP + state(finger1 key, finger2 key, index of word)

time complexity will be O(26*26*n)

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        def manhattan_distance(src, dest):
            x1, y1 = src%6, src//6
            x2, y2 = dest%6, dest//6
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        @cache
        def dfs(f1, f2, i):
            if i == n: return 0
            key = ord(word[i])-ord('A')
            return min(dfs(key,f2,i+1)+manhattan_distance(f1,key),dfs(f1,key,i+1)+manhattan_distance(f2,key))
        best = inf
        for i in range(26):
            for j in range(26):
                best = min(best, dfs(i,j,0))
        return best        
```

## solution 2: Iterative DP

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        def manhattan_distance(src, dest):
            x1, y1 = src%6, src//6
            x2, y2 = dest%6, dest//6
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        def map_char(ch):
            return ord(ch)-ord('A')
        # INITIAL FINGER POSITIONS
        dp = {(map_char(word[0]), f2): 0 for f2 in range(26)}
        for ch in word:
            dp2 = defaultdict(lambda: inf)
            key = map_char(ch)
            for (f1, f2), cost in dp.items():
                dp2[(key, f2)] = min(dp2[(key, f2)], cost + manhattan_distance(f1, key))
                dp2[(f1, key)] = min(dp2[(f1, key)], cost + manhattan_distance(f2, key))
            dp = dp2
        return min(dp.values())
```

## Solution 3: Optimized recursive DP + states (index of word, position of other finger)

That is we know that one finger will always be on the last key pressed, so we don't need to store it's posisiton
because it can be found.  We only need to track the position of the other finger which means it is not at the 
same position as last key, of course maybe it could be. But most likely it will not.  

time complexity is down to O(26*n) which is really just O(n), as long as alphabet is fixed in size (keyboard keys are 
fixed in size)

```py
class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        def manhattan_distance(src, dest):
            x1, y1 = src%6, src//6
            x2, y2 = dest%6, dest//6
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        @cache
        def dfs(i, other):
            if i == n: return 0
            key = ord(word[i])-ord('A')
            last_key = ord(word[i-1])-ord('A')
            return min(dfs(i+1, other) + manhattan_distance(last_key, key), dfs(i+1,last_key)+manhattan_distance(other,key))
        best = inf
        for i in range(26):
            best = min(best, dfs(1,i))
        return best
```

## Solution 4: Optimized iterative DP


```py
class Solution:
    def minimumDistance(self, word: str) -> int:
        n = len(word)
        def manhattan_distance(src, dest):
            x1, y1 = src%6, src//6
            x2, y2 = dest%6, dest//6
            return abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2)
        # INITIAL FINGER POSITIONS
        dp = {other: 0 for other in range(26)}
        for pch, ch in zip(word, word[1:]):
            dp2 = defaultdict(lambda: inf)
            key = ord(ch)-ord('A')
            last_key = ord(pch)-ord('A')
            for other, cost in dp.items():
                dp2[other] = min(dp2[other], cost + manhattan_distance(last_key,key))
                dp2[last_key] = min(dp2[last_key], cost + manhattan_distance(other, key))
            dp = dp2
        return min(dp.values())
