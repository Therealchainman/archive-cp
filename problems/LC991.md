# 991. Brokent Calculator

## Solution:  Greedy + backwards

Solve from the target and go until you are less than or equal to startValue.  Because we are greedily
choosing to divide by 2 we are able to get the time complexity into the logarithmic range. 

proof:

if we have a sequence of [+1, +1, /2] can we shorten this by doing [/2, +1]

(4+1+1)/2 = 3
4/2+1=3

```py
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, startValue: int, target: int) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        while target > startValue:
            if target%2==0:
                target//=2
            else:
                target+=1
            cnt += 1
        return cnt + startValue - target
```
