# Rearrange Array to Avoid Adjacent Duplicates

Sometimes it can also by cyclical, but the algorithm still works for that. 

step 1: count frequencies and do a sort by descending value. 

step 2: 
place value sin even positions first, , and by doing this no two are adjacent. 

For the cyclical variation if any element appears more than n / 2 times then it is impossible to rearrange so no two adjacent elements are adjacent.
