# 729. My Calendar I

## Solution:  Brute force 

O(N^2), this algorithm iterates through every interval to find any overlap or double bookings
if it doesn't it appends this new interval to the calendar

```py
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        # INCLUSIVE INTERVALS
        self.calendar = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        for s, e in self.calendar:
            if s < end and start < e: return False
        self.calendar.append((start, end))
        return True

# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```

The logic is that two intervals do not overlap if one of them starts after the other one ends. 

so does s1>=e2 or does s2>=e1 is the question

```py
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        # INCLUSIVE INTERVALS
        self.calendar = []

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        for s, e in self.calendar:     
            if not (end <= s or start >= e): 
                return False
        self.calendar.append((start, end))
        return True


# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```

## Solution: SortedList in python with bisect_right binary search.

```py
from sortedcontainers import SortedList
from bisect import bisect_right
class MyCalendar:

    def __init__(self):
        # INCLUSIVE INTERVALS
        self.calendar = SortedList()

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        i = bisect_right(self.calendar, (end, 0))
        if i>0:
            i-=1
        if len(self.calendar)> 0 and not (start >= self.calendar[i][1] or self.calendar[i][0] >= end): return False
        self.calendar.add((start, end))
        return True


# Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendar()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)
```
