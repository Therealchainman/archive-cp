# 299. Bulls and Cows

## Solution 1: counting + hash maps

```py
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        num_bulls = 0
        sfreq, gfreq = [0]*10, [0]*10
        for s, g in zip(secret, guess):
            if s==g:
                num_bulls += 1
                continue
            sfreq[ord(s)-ord('0')]+=1
            gfreq[ord(g)-ord('0')]+=1
        num_cows = sum(min(s,g) for s,g in zip(sfreq, gfreq))
        return f"{num_bulls}A{num_cows}B"
```

## Solution 2: One pass + one hash map

if freq[digit] > 0 that means it has a surplus of secrets that have not been matched with a corresponding guess of same digit
if freq[digit] < 0 that means it has a surplus of guesses that hav enot been matched with a corresponding secret of same digit

```py
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        num_bulls = num_cows = 0
        freq = Counter()
        for s, g in zip(secret, guess):
            if s==g:
                num_bulls += 1
            else:
                num_cows += int(freq[s] < 0) + int(freq[g] > 0)
                freq[s] += 1
                freq[g] -= 1
        return f"{num_bulls}A{num_cows}B"
```
