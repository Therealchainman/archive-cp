# 997. Find the Town Judge

### Solution: Count indegrees and outdegrees, judge should have all nodes with indegree on it and have no outdegree edges.

```c++
int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
    vector<int> indegrees(n+1,0), outdegrees(n+1,0);
    for (vector<int>& p : trust) {
        indegrees[p[1]]++;
        outdegrees[p[0]]++;
    }
    for (int i = 1;i<=n;i++) {
        if (indegrees[i]-outdegrees[i]==n-1) {
            return i;
        } 
    }
    return -1;
}
```
