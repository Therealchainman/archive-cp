# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

## Solution: iterative DP 

2 cases
1. Find the max profit on the ith day for a the first transaction with a forward traversal of keeping tack of the minimum value on previous day
2. Find the max profit on the ith day for the second transaction with a backward traversal of keeping track of the maximum value on a future day

```py
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        # forward traversal, profits record the max profit 
        # by the ith day, this is the first transaction
        profits = []
        max_profit = 0
        current_min = math.inf
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            max_profit = max(max_profit,prices[i]-current_min)
            current_min = min(current_min, prices[i])
            profits.append(max_profit)
        
        # backward traversal, to record the max profit
        # by the ith day, this is for the second transaction
        current_max = -math.inf
        profits2 = [0 for _ in range(len(prices))]
        max_profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices))[::-1]:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, current_max-prices[i])
            current_max = max(current_max,prices[i])
            profits2[i] = max_profit
        return max(p1+p2 for p1,p2 in zip(profits,profits2))
