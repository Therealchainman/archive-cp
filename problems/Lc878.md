Nth Magical Number

Solutions: Binary search O(logN)

The solution uses lcm from the gcd.  This is like the inclusion-exclusion principle. Basically num/a gives us
the number of integers that are multiples of a that are in num.  And same for num/b.  We want to include
these as magical numbers in the result.  But there are some numbers that are duplicate from a and b.  We find
those by taking the lcm of lcm(a,b) = a*b/gcd(a,b).  

```c++
const long long INF = 1e14;
const int MOD = 1e9+7;
int nthMagicalNumber(long long n, long long a, long long b) {
    long long lo = 2, hi = min(a,b)*n;
    long long lcm = a*b / __gcd(a,b);
    auto possible = [&](const long long num) {
        return num/a + num/b - num/lcm>= n;
    };
    while (lo<hi) {
        long long mid = lo+hi>>1;
        if (!possible(mid)) {
            lo = mid+1;
        } else {
            hi = mid;
        }
    }
    return lo%MOD;
}
```
