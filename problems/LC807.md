O(n^2) solution using the fact that if you store the max for each north, east, west, south, then you
can just get the min for the skyline for each one and increase value by that.  

```c++
int maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
    int n = grid.size();
    vector<int> north(n, -INF), south(n, -INF), east(n, -INF), west(n, -INF);
    for (int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
        for (int j = 0;j<n;j++) {
            east[i] = max(east[i], grid[i][j]);
            west[i] = max(west[i], grid[i][j]);
            north[j] = max(north[j], grid[i][j]);
            south[j] = max(south[j], grid[i][j]);
        }
    }
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
        for (int j = 0;j<n;j++) {
            int limit = min({east[i], west[i], north[j], south[j]});
            cnt += max(0, limit - grid[i][j]);
        }
    }
    return cnt;
}
```
