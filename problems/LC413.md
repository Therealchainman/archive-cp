# 413. Arithmetic Slices

## Solution: Dynamic Programming

For a sequence of at least 3 numbers that have the same differnce, we increment delta to 1
then each sequence of 3 numbers with same difference after that we increment delta by 1 again
and increase total count of possible arithmetic contiguous sequences. 

```py
class Solution:
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        delta = 0
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            if nums[i]-nums[i-1] == nums[i-1]-nums[i-2]:
                delta += 1
                cnt += delta
            else:
                delta = 0
        return cnt
```
