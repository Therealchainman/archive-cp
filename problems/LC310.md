Minimum Height Trees


Solutions:  topological sort, BFS, DFS

Solution 1: Topological sort with bfs

It is an interesting solution, but basically the final nodes that remain after removing all the leaf nodes repeatedly
in a topological sort manner, The last nodes visited in topological sort are guaranteed to be the ones with the minimum 
height.  The reason is we are finding the mid nodes in the graph.  

It is also similar to a two pointer solution to find the mid node. 

```c++
vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
    if (n==1) {return {0};}
    vector<vector<int>> graph(n);
    vector<int> indegrees(n,0);
    for (vector<int>& edge : edges) {
        graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        graph[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        indegrees[edge[0]]++;
        indegrees[edge[1]]++;
    }
    queue<int> leaves;
    for (int i = 0;i<n;i++) {
        if (indegrees[i]==1) {
            leaves.push(i);
        }
    }
    vector<int> roots;
    while (!leaves.empty()) {
        int sz = leaves.size();
        roots.clear();
        while (sz--) {
            int node = leaves.front();
            roots.push_back(node);
            leaves.pop();
            for (int& nei : graph[node]) {
                if (--indegrees[nei]==1) {
                    leaves.push(nei);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return roots;
}
```

Solution 2: 2 DFS to find tree diameter

You can find the diameter of a tree with 2 DFS, the diameter of a tree is the longest distance between any two leaf nodes. 


```c++

```


Solution 3:  dfs + memoization

## solution 3: bfs + topological sort

```py
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        if n==1: return [0]
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        indegrees = [0]*n
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
            indegrees[u]+=1
            indegrees[v]+=1
        queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegrees[i] == 1])
        root = []
        while queue:
            sz = len(queue)
            root.clear()
            for _ in range(sz):
                node = queue.popleft()
                root.append(node)
                for nei in graph[node]:
                    indegrees[nei] -= 1
                    if indegrees[nei] == 1:
                        queue.append(nei)
        return root
```
