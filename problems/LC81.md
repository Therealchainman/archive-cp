# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

```py
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        for num in nums:
            if num==target: return True
        return False
```

## Solution: Binary search

Binary search but with two arrays you have array S and array F, both are 
non-decreasing arrays.  But normall the arrays are array S + array F, but with the 
pivot point it get's rotated and you have array F + array S

The following you just need to consider 4 cases to solve the problem

special case: This is for it you can't determine which array mid belongs in, which is the case 
when nums[mid]==nums[lo], because you don't know which array it belongs to.
case 1: if mid in F and target in F, then you just need to look at comparison of target to nums[mid]
case 2: if mid in S and target in S, then you just need to look at comparison of target to nums[mid]
case 3: if mid in F and target in S, then you need to look to right of mid
case 3: if mid in S and target in F, then you need to look to left of mid
