# Linear Independence

This is a very useful property to understand about linear independence

When you have three linearly independent vectors, you can linearly combine them to produce another vector, including a vector that might resemble one of the original three in your terms of a third vector.  However, itâ€™s important to clarify that linear combination allows you to produce any vector in the space spanned by these three vectors, which could be an entirely new vector.

With this you can create a new vector or if these are equations, create a third equation, example of problem this is related to is riddle of the sphinx from ICPC world finals 47 (2023)
