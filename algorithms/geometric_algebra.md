# Geometric Algebra

## Bivectors

bivector is a 2 dimensional equivalent of a vector which is 1 dimensional.  And a scalar is 0 dimensional.  Bivector is also like an oriented area.  It always has area, while vector has 0 area.  But it always has length and scalar as 0 length. 

## geometric product

outer product is better than cross product.  Don't think in terms of cross product, but in terms of outer product
