# Permutation Cycle

What need to know about permutation cycles

They are directed graphs, functional graphs, or sometimes represented as undirected graph with disjoint cycles.

You can swap elements in the permutation and this will cause two things to happen, 
- merge(u, v) and u and v are part of different cycles, you merge those two cycles and the new cycle is the c1 + c2 
- merge(u, v) and u and v are part of same cycle, then you split that cycle into two cycles.
