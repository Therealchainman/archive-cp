## Handshaking lemma

The handshaking lemma states that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any finite undirected graph is equal to twice the number of edges. This is because each edge connects two vertices, so when summing the degrees, each edge contributes to the degree of two vertices, effectively being counted twice. A key implication is that there must always be an even number of vertices with odd degrees in any graph
