# Single Source Shortest Path Problem

In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm can solve this problem if the graph contained positive edge weights.

For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.â€Š It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. 

### Python implementation for source to destination node

This is a good implementation that has a constant time improvement over a few other ways you could implement it.  The vis[v]: continue prevents it from adding values that are not necessary.

w >= 0

```py
def dijkstra(adj, src, dst):
    N = len(adj)
    min_heap = [(0, src)]
    vis = [0] * N
    while min_heap:
        cost, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if u == dst: return cost
        if vis[u]: continue
        vis[u] = 1
        for v, w in adj[u]:
            if vis[v]: continue
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (cost + w, v))
    return -1
```

### Python implementation for all nodes

It is the same, just doesn't early terminate

Is this one still necessary? I think the one above is the better approach

```py
import math
def dijkstra(adj, src):
    N = len(adj)
    min_heap = [(0, src)]
    vis = [math.inf] * N
    while min_heap:
        cost, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if vis[u] < math.inf: continue
        vis[u] == cost
        for v, w in adj[u]:
            if vis[v] < math.inf: continue
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (cost + w, v))
    return -1
```

### Cpp implementation for source to destination node

untested, but same as python dijkstra

```cpp
bool dijkstra(int src, int dst) {
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;
    vector<bool> vis(N, false);
    pq.emplace(0, src);
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        auto [cost, u] = pq.top();
        pq.pop();
        if (u == dst) return cost;
        if (vis[u]) continue;
        vis[u] = true;
        for (auto [v, w] : adj[u]) {
            if (vis[v]) continue;
            pq.emplace(cost + w, v);
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

## dijkstra for when you need the distance to all nodes from source node

```py
import math
import heapq
def dijkstra(adj, src):
    N = len(adj)
    min_heap = [(0, src)]
    dist = [math.inf] * N
    while min_heap:
        cost, u = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if cost >= dist[u]: continue
        dist[u] = cost
        for v, w in adj[u]:
            if cost + w < dist[v]: heapq.heappush(min_heap, (cost + w, v))
    return dist
```
