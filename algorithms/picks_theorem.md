# Pick's Theorem

Lattice Polygons: polygons whose vertices are lattice points.

Lattice Points are points with integer coordinates.

 Pick's theorem gives a formula for the area of a lattice polygon.

 B = number of points on the boundary of the polygon

 I = number of points in the interior of the polygon

Pick's theorem gives this formula for the
 area of polygon P = I + B/2 - 1
