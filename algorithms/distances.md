# Distances

Chebyshev distance, also referred to as the maximum metric, or the square-ring distance is a metric that calculates the distance between two points in a grid-based system by taking the maximum of the absolute differences of their coordinates. In a 2D grid, it can be expressed as:

```
max(|x2 - x1|, |y2 - y1|)
```

Manhattan distance, also known as the taxicab or city block distance or diamond-ring distance, is a metric that calculates the distance between two points in a grid-based system by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. In a 2D grid, it can be expressed as:

```
|x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|
```
