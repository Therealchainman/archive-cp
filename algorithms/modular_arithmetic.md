# Modular Arithmetic


## congruence relation modulo n

modular congruence means that two integers are in the same equivalence class under some (mod m).  Imagine = is congruence symbol.  a = b(modm) implies that with division algorithm a = mq + r, where 0 <= r < m.  And b = mq + r, and both have the same remainder.  So when divided by m they have same remainder.  

It is somewhat obvious by definition of modular congruence that if you do this

a = b(modm) => a + m = b(modm) => a = (b+m)(modm)

If you add m either side they will still be in the same equivalence class cause they are just wrapping around at m.  So it still has same remainder.

Another property is 

 a*b = (a(modm) * b(modm))(modm) 

That is the multiplication of two integer a and b will be in the same congruence class as the multiplication of a and b modulo m.  When they are all under the modulus m. 

## Second note on modular congruence

Let's derive a statement about modular congruence.

given $$a \equiv b \mod c$$ let's prove that $$ c | (a - b) $$ (c divides a - b)

So modular congruence can be thought of as the remainder of a and b when divided by c are the same. 
1. a = nc + r
2. b = mc + r

Since by definition both have the same remainder, you can set a - nc = b - mc which leads to the result that c divides a - b.  $$\frac{a - b}{c} = n - m$$
Which means that there is integer result from the division of a - b by c. So c divides a - b.

## GCD and it's connection to Modular Arithmetic

When gcd(N, x) = 1, in modular arithmetic, this implies that when you keep add or subtract x (mod N), you cycle through all distinct residues mod N before returning to your starting point.  

This is because when gcd(N, x) = 1, x is relatively prime to N.  So when you keep adding x to itself, you will eventually reach a multiple of N.  And since x is relatively prime to N, you will not reach a multiple of N before you reach all the residues.  So you will cycle through all the residues before you reach a multiple of N.  This is a useful property in some problems.

The relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers and the partitioning of a set into distinct cycles is a concept rooted in number theory, particularly in the study of modular arithmetic and cyclic groups.

Understanding the Concept:

Consider the set of integers {0, 1, 2, ..., N-1}. When examining the sequence generated by repeatedly adding a fixed integer x modulo N, i.e., the sequence 0, (0 + x) mod N, (0 + 2x) mod N, and so on, the behavior of this sequence is determined by gcd(N, x).

If gcd(N, x) = d, then the sequence will cycle through a subset of the integers {0, 1, 2, ..., N-1} before repeating. Specifically, it will cover every d-th element in this set. Consequently, there will be d distinct cycles needed to cover all elements from 0 to N-1. Each cycle corresponds to one of the d cosets of the subgroup generated by x in the additive group of integers modulo N.
Mathematical Foundation:

This concept is closely related to the structure of cyclic groups in modular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, the set of integers modulo N forms a group under addition, denoted as ℤ/Nℤ. The element x in this group generates a cyclic subgroup whose order is N/d, where d = gcd(N, x). The number of distinct cosets of this subgroup is d, which corresponds to the d separate cycles needed to cover all elements of the set.
