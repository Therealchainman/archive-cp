# Infinite Geometric Series

## Example derivative of infinite geometric series

This can be found by differentiating an infinite geometric series.

```py
# p + 2*p^2 + 3*p^3 + 4*p^4 + ... = p/(1-p)^2
def inf_geometric_series(p):
    return p / (1 - p) ** 2
```

## Geometric Distribution

Often times this is useful for when you are dealing with geometric distribution.  Which is the tells you when something will happen? For example, if you are flipping a coin, how many times will you have to flip it before you get a head?  Or shooting a basketball, how many times you have to shoot to make a baseket given some probability per shot.
