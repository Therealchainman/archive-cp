# Codingame Spring Challenge 2022

## Summary

Bot programming challenge for the Spring 2020 Codingame platform.


Right now just have my heroes going towards the spiders that are closest to base and spiders that are closest to that hero, and prioritize any spider that is threatening the base. 


Another strategy is to keep all heroes in same location and have them concentrate effort on single spider that is closest
But really we only care about spiders that will reach our base proximity via a vector calculation
