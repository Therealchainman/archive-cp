# Division 2

## Problem: Data Center

This metric is called the chebyshev distance, which can be converted into 
a manhattan distance by rotating the coordinates 45 degrees. 

And the problem can be reduced to minimize the manhattan distance

Can use a prefix for the sum of distance along each dimension for what is to the left and to the right?
