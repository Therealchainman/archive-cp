## Problem: Digest Recommendation

### Solution: arrays + looping

user and story are 1-indexed, there will be [1,n] stories
and [1,m] users.

p + q follows 
I imagine the follows as just being directed edges
p user->user edges
q user->story edges

This algorithm is actually just using arrays but it still 
is difficult to keep track of all the details, there is 
about 5 2d arrays I used.
